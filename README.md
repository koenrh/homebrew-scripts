# Homebrew scripts

This is my Homebrew tap for some of my scripts.

## Usage

You need to have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed.

[Tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/brew-tap) into this repository:

```bash
$ brew tap koenrh/scripts
```

You can install the scripts just as any other Homebrew formula. For example, install `diceware`:

```bash
$ brew install diceware
```
